# R-scripts-for-spatial-data-processing

I am collecting here simple R scripts for processing and analysis of spatial data.
Mostly very basic stuff that I have found useful on a regular basis.

This is a work in progress, any comments and suggestions are welcome!

### Reading and writing spatial data in R

1. Reading shapefiles (coming up..)
2. Reading coordinate information from text files (coming up..)
3. Writing shapefiles (coming up..)
3. [Getting data from MS Access database] (ReadingDataIntoR/GetDataFromMSAccess.R)
4. Getting data from PostgreSQL database (coming up..)

### Map visualizations in R

1. [Plot points on a simple world map] (Visualization/PlotPointsOnAMap_rworldmap.R)
2. [Plot points on google maps] (Visualization/PlotPointsOnAMap_ggmap.R)



### Geotagged Social Media Data in R

1. Getting tweets (no code here yet)
2. [Plot points on google maps] (Visualization/PlotPointsOnAMap_ggmap.R) or [Plot points on a simple world map] (Visualization/PlotPointsOnAMap_rworldmap.R)
3. [Plotting wordclouds] (Wordclouds/PlotWordClouds.R)
