# Text mining

Code for text processing, plotting word frequencies and wordclouds in R
Custom-made for tweet text and instagram captions from Finland, but should work with any data table with text
Note, use preferably R 3.3.1 or newer!

These scripts are a work in progress, don't hesitate to raise an issue if you find something that is not working!

1. Creating a corpus
2. Plotting wordclouds
3. Plotting most frequent words
