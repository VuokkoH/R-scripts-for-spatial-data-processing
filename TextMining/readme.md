# Text mining

Code for text processing, plotting word frequencies and wordclouds in R

Custom-made for tweet text and instagram captions from Finland, but should work with any data table with text

***Note, use preferably R 3.3.1 or newer!***

These scripts are a work in progress, don't hesitate to raise an issue if you find something that is not working!

## Basic steps:

1. Creating a corpus (this step is currently included in the other scripts)
2. [Plotting wordclouds] (/TextMining/PlotWordClouds.R)
3. [Plotting most frequent words] (/TextMining/readme.md)

In order to run these scripts you need to first read in your data..
